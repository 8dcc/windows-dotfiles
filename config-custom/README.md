### `config_custom.txt`

You will need to place this file anywhere in your system, just add the path to:
```bash
# (Win+Alt+P)
Settings -> Startup -> Tasks file
```
After that you will need to edit the file and change `C:\YOUR-FOLDER\HOME-FOLDER` with the path you want cmder to start in.  
You will also need to change `C:C:\YOUR-CMDER-FOLDER\cmder\icons\cmder.ico` with your cmder installation path. **You need to keep the first `C:`, the path starts in the seccond one.**
